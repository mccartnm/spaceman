Spaceman Space Defender Game Thing

Player is cast into the depths of space to explore some odd behaviour going on about the cosmos.

There's loot to find, pirates and factions to kill, ships to steal, and more (eventually)!

Ships are built dynamically* and then fed into the system for drawing and processing.

A ship can have any number hardpoints, which equate to weapons (for now) to use against the forces of evil!
